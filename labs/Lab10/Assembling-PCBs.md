## Preparation

Assembling a board (especially your first one) can take a couple hours.  Also, the working time for the solder paste is limited, so you need to work reasonably quickly once you start.

Begin by making sure you have everything you need. 

## Applying Solder Paste

### What You Need

1. Blue tape
2. *Solder stencil*
3. 4 scrap PCBs the same thickness as your board. 
4. 1 large putty knife
5. 1 small putty knife
6. Butcher paper
7. Gloves
8. A magnifier
9. Alcohol in a pump dispenser
10. Chem wipes
11. Compressed air
12. Solder paste

### Preparing Your Space and Aligning Your Stencil

You need a large, clear space to apply solder paste.

1. It can be messy, so cover everything with butcher paper.
2. Tape down your scrap PCBs so they will hold your board still.  The PCB should be oriented so the stencil aligns with it in "portrait" orienation (tall rather than wide).
3. Align your stencil with your board so the wholes line up perfectly with the pads. This must be very precise.
4. Tape down the right edge of your stencil so you can easily lift it on and off your board like a page of a book.
5. Check the alignment again
6. Verify your alignment with course staff.

### Apply Paste

1. Use the narrow putty knife to apply a thin (1cm) bead of paste to the edge of the wide putty knife.
2. Hold the wide putty knife at a 45-degree angle and drag it across the stencil, forcing the paste through the holes.  Press pretty hard and move smoothly.  Make sure you align the knife so it will pass over all the pads on the board.  You can only make one pass. 
3. Carefully and gently and in one motion, lift up the stencil and fold it back.
4. Examine the paste pattern with your magnifier.  Look out for
   * Pads with missing paste
   * indistict or touching paste blobs (esp. on the IMU and microcontrollers)
5. Check it with course staff and point out any problems you spotted.
6. If it looks good, carefully remove your board.
7. If something is wrong, you'll need to remove all the paste using chemwipes and alcohol and start again.

### Cleanup

1. If someone else is going to use putty knifes immediately, you can leave them.
2. If not (or in doubt), clean them my scraping the paste back into its container and wiping them with alchol and chemwipes.
3. Wipe up any stray solder paste on the table, *both* sides of the stencil.
4. Blow any remaining solder paste out of the stencil holes with compressed air.
