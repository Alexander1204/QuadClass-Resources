# The Quadcopter Class

## Using Github Classroom

1.  Create an organization for the course.  Reuse the same org year-to-year.
2.  Create new assignments for each year (e.g., "Building eagle Parts 2018").  Student repos are grouped by assignment, so if you reuse last year's you'll see all their repos too.
3.  When you create new assignments for a year, disable the invitation link for the old assignments so students don't accidently use them.
